# QuadraticEquations
Quadratic equations are polynomial equations having a degree of 2. It is represented by the equation, ax² + bx +c = 0, where a, b and c are the coefficients, where the value of a cannot be zero (a != 0), and the value of x is used to find the roots of a quadratic equation represented as (a, b). Here, coefficients are assumed to be integers but roots may or may not be real.

The roots of a quadratic equation can be defined in three ways: real and distinct, real and equal, and real and imaginary. The nature of the root is decided by the discriminant (b²-4ac).

If the value of the discriminant comes to less than zero, then the roots are imaginary, or if it is greater than zero, then the roots are real, and if the value of the discriminant is zero, then the roots are equal.
